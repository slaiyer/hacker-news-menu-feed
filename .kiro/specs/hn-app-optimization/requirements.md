# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the optimization and architectural improvements needed for the existing Hacker News menu bar application. The current app works functionally but has several performance, architectural, and code quality issues that need to be addressed. The primary focus is on reducing feed reload time while improving overall app performance, memory usage, and code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Hacker News feed to reload as quickly as possible, so that I can access fresh content without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app fetches the feed THEN the system SHALL complete the operation in under 3 seconds for 100 posts
2. WHEN multiple API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection pooling and request batching
3. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load cached data immediately while fetching fresh content in the background
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with circuit breaker pattern
5. IF cached data exists THEN the system SHALL display it immediately and update incrementally as new data arrives

### Requirement 2: Memory Management and Resource Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to use minimal system resources, so that it doesn't impact my Mac's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is running THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage under 50MB during normal operation
2. WHEN posts are updated THEN the system SHALL properly deallocate old post data to prevent memory leaks
3. WHEN the app is idle THEN the system SHALL minimize background processing and network activity
4. WHEN images or external content are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching with size limits
5. IF the app has been running for extended periods THEN the system SHALL maintain stable memory usage without growth

### Requirement 3: Architecture and Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow Swift and macOS best practices, so that the app is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns using proper MVVM or similar architecture pattern
2. WHEN handling data THEN the system SHALL implement a proper data layer with repository pattern
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management patterns for SwiftUI
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
5. IF new features are added THEN the system SHALL support easy extension without major refactoring

### Requirement 4: Data Persistence and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remember my preferences and show cached content when offline, so that I have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load the last fetched posts from local storage
2. WHEN posts are fetched THEN the system SHALL cache them locally with appropriate expiration
3. WHEN user preferences change THEN the system SHALL persist them using proper data storage mechanisms
4. WHEN the network is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached content with appropriate indicators
5. IF cached data is stale THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh while showing the cached version

### Requirement 5: Network Layer Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable and fast network operations, so that the app works consistently even with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout handling and retry logic
2. WHEN fetching multiple posts THEN the system SHALL optimize concurrent requests to avoid rate limiting
3. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt request strategies accordingly
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize data before processing
5. IF API endpoints are slow THEN the system SHALL implement request prioritization and cancellation
